Write the desired file F.ipynb so that:
1. (Descriptive text) All descriptive text gets saved in a .txt file
2. (Relevant Visualizations) All visualizations get saved as a .png file and placed in a compressed folder
3. (Data Tables) All relevant statistics saved in a matrix, which gets saved as a .csv file.

Input:
.ipynb file F
integers n and a

Process:
1. copy F.ipynb into F_n1.ipynb, F_n2.ipynb, ..., F_na.ipynb
2. create folder for each copy
3. run each copy
4. collect descriptive text, png file folder (compressed), and csv file for each and place in a folder F_ni_Data
5. create "F_Data" folder containing each F_n1_Data, F_n2_Data, ..., F_na_Data folder

Idea:

After searching for each desired n, can merge the F_Data folders so that the main result is relevant descriptive text, visualizations, and data tables for the structure F over all desired n.
