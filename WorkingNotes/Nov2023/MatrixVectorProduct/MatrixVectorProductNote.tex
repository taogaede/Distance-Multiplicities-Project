\title{ \vspace{-3cm} Note on Expressing Multiplicities as Matrix Vector Product in Subclass of Trees }
%\author{Tao Gaede}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	Let $T$ be a tree with diameter $d$ and $r$ internal vertices.  Let $m(x)$ be the multiplicity of distance $x$ in $T$.  Let $I_T$ be the tree induced by the internal vertices of $T$.  Suppose that $T$ satisfies the property that $I_T$ has max degree $3$ and at most one vertex with degree $3$, with the remaining vertices having degree at most $2$.  Note that $T$ can be any caterpillar as well as a tree constructed from three caterpillars joined at the ends of their internal trees.  Note that a tree $T$ has the corollary property that the multiplicities of distances in $I_T$ never exceed $r$.  These properties turn out to be important for representing the multiplicity vector $\mathbf{m} = [m(3), m(4), \ldots, m(d)]^T$ of $T$ as a matrix vector product.
	
	\paragraph{Observation}
		  Recall for any distance $x \in [3,d]$, we have
		$$m(x) = \sum_{\substack{\{u,v\} \in {V(T) \choose 2} \\ d(u,v) = x-2}} (\deg(u)-1) (\deg(v)-1).$$
		
		Note that this is just a dot product of internal vertex degree vectors.  Since the max multiplicity of distances in $I_T$ is at most $r$, there are at most $r$ terms (possibly with value $0$) in $m(x)$.
		
	\paragraph{Making the vector and matrix}
	
		Suppose we order (in some generally standardized way) the internal vertices of $T$ as $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_r$.  Then set $a_i := \deg(u_i)-1$.  Define the vector $\mathbf{v} = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r]^T$.  Then there exists a $(d-2) \times (r)$ matrix $B$ with entries coming from the set $\{0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r\}$ such that $\mathbf{m} = B\mathbf{v}$.
		
		The $(i,j)$ entry of $B$ corresponds to paths of length $i$ in $I_T$ involving vertex $u_j$.  We have that $B_{i,j} = 0$ iff there does not exist a path of length $i$ involving $u_j$ in $I_T$.  Otherwise, if $B_{i,j} = a_k$ for some $k \in [r]$, then there exists a path of length $i$ between $u_j$ and $u_k$ in $I_T$.  The special degree property of $T$ ensures that the distance $i$ graph of $I_T$ has max degree $2$, which means it's a union of paths and triangles (i.e. there are no cliques of order greater than $3$).  This means that every path of length $i$ in $I_T$ can be accounted for as a unique non-zero entry of $B$.  So, it is always possible to place the $a_k$s in the appropriate entries of $B$ to produce the desired dot products with $\mathbf{v}$.  Thus all of the multiplicity for distance $i+2$ is accounted for in $B\mathbf{v}$.
		
	\paragraph{Idea}
	Suppose we are given $\mathbf{v}$.  Then search the possible ways to assign values from $\{0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_r\}$ to entries of $B$ to see how $B$ transforms the degree vector $\mathbf{v}$ into a distance multiplicity vector.
